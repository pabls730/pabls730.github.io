<p>Teen Vogue is a US magazine which was launched in 2004 as a sister publication to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)">Vogue</a>, targeted at teenage girls. Like Vogue, it includes stories about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion">fashion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity">celebrities</a>.[2] Since 2015, the magazine has moved its focus away from shopping and fashion features into more topical content, including politics and current affairs.[3][4][5] </p>

<h1>history</h1>

<p>Teen Vogue was established in 2004.[6] The magazine is published in a smaller 6¾"x9" format to afford it more visibility on shelves and some flexibility getting into a  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_size">digest size</a> slot at checkout stands.[7]

In May 2016, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Welteroth">Elaine Welteroth</a> was appointed as editor, replacing the founding editor-in-chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Astley">Amy Astley</a>. Her appointment at 29 saw her become the youngest editor-in-chief in Condé Nast's history, and the second African-American.[4] She works closely with digital editorial director Phillip Picardi and creative director Marie Suter.[3]

In November 2016, it was announced Teen Vogue would start publishing quarterly, following the Dec/Jan 2017 issue.[8]

In December 2016, the magazine published an opinion article by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Duca">Lauren Duca</a>, the magazine’s weekend editor, entitled "Donald Trump Is Gaslighting America."[9] Within weeks, the essay had been viewed 1.2 million times, and on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR">NPR's</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Things_Considered">All Things Considered</a> ,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Folkenflik">David Folkenflik </a> described the essay as signaling a shift in the magazine's emphasis toward more political and social engagement.[10] According to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times">The New York Times</a>, many media observers were "surprised to see a magazine for teenagers making such a strong political statement,"[11] although Folkenflik acknowledged he drew criticism for expressing this surprise and at  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine)">Slate</a>, Mark Joseph Stern argued the essay was consistent with the magazine's record, since the appointment of Welteroth and Picardi, as a "teen glossy with seriously good political coverage and legal analysis, an outlet for teenagers who—shockingly!—are able to think about fashion and current events simultaneously."[12] At <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic">The Atlantic</a> , Sophie Gilbert similarly noted, "The pivot in editorial strategy has drawn praise on social media, with some writers commenting that Teen Vogue is doing a better job of covering important stories in 2016 than legacy news publications."[</p>
